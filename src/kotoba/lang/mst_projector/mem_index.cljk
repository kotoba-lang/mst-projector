(ns kotoba.lang.mst-projector.mem-index
  "Reference `IIndex` implementation for `kotoba.lang.mst-projector.indexer`:
  an in-memory atom-backed store, with OPTIONAL EDN-file persistence for
  durability across restarts.

  Why not LanceDB (or any other real embedded DB)? Per this repo's README
  and the session's substrate policy: LanceDB has no real JVM/Clojure
  story, and this ecosystem is deliberately wary of bolting a specific
  centralized DB dependency onto a `kotoba-lang` library -- the whole point
  of `IIndex` (mirroring `kotoba.lang.ipfs/IHttp`) is that the pure core
  never commits to one. This reference implementation stays in the
  'minimal deps, pure/portable' spirit this session's sibling ports
  established: zero extra dependencies beyond Clojure core + `clojure.edn`
  (already transitively available), an atom, and (optionally) a flat file.

  Storage model: a single atom holds `{collection-name(String) ->
  [row-map ...]}` (rows in insertion order; see `IIndex/-upsert!`'s
  replace-moves-to-end contract). This is adequate for the projector's own
  workload (test/dev-scale record counts; production-scale deployments
  should write a heavier `IIndex` backend, e.g. an actual embedded/columnar
  store, when that's justified -- the protocol itself does not change).

  Persistence: when constructed with `:persist-path`, the ENTIRE atom
  contents are re-serialised (via `pr-str`) to that file after every
  mutating call and read back (via `clojure.edn/read-string`) at
  construction time. This is a full-rewrite-per-write strategy -- simple
  and correct, but O(total data size) per write, so it is a reference/
  small-scale durability option, not a production write path. Values are
  restricted to plain EDN (rows only ever contain String/number/boolean/
  nil per `flatten-record`'s contract), so no custom EDN reader is needed
  and `read-string` is always safe here (no `#`-tagged literals ever
  written)."
